**High Level Design for Lab 3-1**

1) Application 1 starts
2) Variables are created to hold the user inputs
3) Entry of user inputs begin
    prompt user for 2 numbers
    store numbers
4) The program outputs specified calculations
5) Step 3-4 repeat until user enters a 0
6) The application ends

1) Application 2 starts
2) Variable created to store random number
    Random number generated
3) Entry of user inputs begin
    create variable to store input number
    prompt user for number between 1-100 inclusive
4) Program compares input to random number
5) Program outputs high, low, or success
6) Step 3-5 repeat until success
7) The application ends

1) Application 3 starts
2) Color list and quote file stored
    color list associated to quotes
3) Entry of user inputs begin
    prompt and store user for color name
4) Test input against color list
    Success: output quote
    failure: repeat steps 3-4
5) Application ends
